## ‚¨áÔ∏è Installation
This project is just for personal use, so it is not published on PyPI.

Using [pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/) to install directly from github:
```shell
pipx install git+https://github.com/thatlittleboy/lgtm-db
```

## üöÄ Usage
### CLI
This project exposes a simple CLI API that prints out the HTML img tag of a randomly selected gif/image in the db.

```shell
$ lgtm-db
<img alt="wwe-referee-thumbsup" src="https://c.tenor.com/JS6Vtap-SYEAAAAC/wwe-wrestling.gif" width="500">
```
You can then pipe the result into `pbcopy` etc. to copy the result into your clipboard.

**NOTE**: API is very much subject to change.

### Browser user script
Integration with the browser is experimental.
You need to install Greasemonkey / Tampermonkey, and invoke a user script to insert a random gif into the message box (upon PR approval, or any other event you would like).

Sample user scripts for Gitlab and Github are found in the [scripts folder](scripts/greasemonkey).

## üìù Todo
Things that I may or may not get around to doing...
* write a local pre-commit hook in this repo to test:
  * if there are duplicated names (id's should be unique)
  * if there are duplicated urls
* supporting cli args
  * default with no args should print help message
  * selecting random static imgs or gifs: `lgtm-db random`
  * selecting random based on name
* support tags metadata
* automating the release process with some tool (doit? just?)
* support lazy loading of [gallery](docs/gallery.md) markdown file
  * loading can become quite bloated if the gallery gets big

## üìå Release
1. Bump the version number in `setup.cfg` and commit with a commit message `release: v1.0.1`
1. And tag the ref, `git tag v1.0.1`, for example.
